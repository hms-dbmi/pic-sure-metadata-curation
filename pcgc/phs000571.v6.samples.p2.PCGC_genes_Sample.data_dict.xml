Included are samples from the PCGC substudy. Samples are the final preps submitted for genotyping, sequencing, or expression data. For example, if one patient (subject ID) gave one sample, and that sample was processed differently to generate 2 sequencing runs, there would be two rows, both using the same subject ID, but having 2 unique sample IDs. The data table also includes the substudy (phs accession) that the sample belongs to.</description><variable id="subject_id"><name>SUBJID</name><description>Subject ID</description><type>integer</type></variable><variable id="sample_id"><name>SAMPID</name><description>Sample ID</description><type>string</type></variable></data_table>
