"""True positive"" cultures","""True positive"" pulmonary, blood, urine, or other culture per clinical documentation in discharge summary, transfer notes, and/or interim summaries. True positive cultures will usually be matched by an appropriate course of antibiotic treatment.
Culture results that are usually false positives include:
\n\tRespiratory samples that read “oropharyngeal flora” can be ignored
\n\tSamples that grew multiple bacterial types or “multiple colony types” or
“mixed flora” can be ignored if antibiotic sensitivities not done
\n\tCandida (a fungus/yeast) from urine or sputum (but not from other
sources) is assumed to be a contaminant
\n\tCoagulase negative staph” is usually, but not always, a contaminant. If
only one bottle or one set of blood cultures is positive for this, can ignore if clinical notes indicate the team felt this was a contaminant."
